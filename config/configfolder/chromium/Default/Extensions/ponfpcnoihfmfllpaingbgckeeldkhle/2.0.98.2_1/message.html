<h2><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Upcoming change regarding permissions!</h2>
<h4>What will change</h4>
<p>Currently the extension has permissions for YouTube™ (<b>*://www.youtube.com/*</b>) and for my website (<b>*://*.mrfdev.com/*</b>). In the next release I'm gonna remove the permission for my website, and because of this your browser will disable the extension to let you know that permissions have changed. All you will have to do to continue to use the extension is to enable it, no need to reinstall it.</p>
<h4>Why this change?</h4>
<p>The permission for my website is only needed to insert a message in the <a href="https://www.mrfdev.com/how-to-use-enhancer-for-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to use Enhancer for YouTube™</a> page when it is open upon install. I'm gonna do things differently so there is no need to require this permission anymore. It also proves to paranoiacs that my extension is not tracking users, and that unlike what some developers claim it is possible to interact with YouTube™ (including embedded videos) with the bare minimum permissions.<br><br>-----<br>The Developer</p>
